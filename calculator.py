#the first step in testing is to lint the code which checks for possible
#syntactical errors

#the second step is unit testing
#unit testing is designed to check a single function or unit of code

#another standard that goes hand in hand with testing is called code
#coverage. coverage is the percentage of the source code that is
#covered by tests
